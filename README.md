# My ZSH Config
This repo contains my fancy zsh config and all the files needed to get it done.

Steps for installation:

* Install zsh on your system. This will also install oh-my-zsh on your system and get you a nice .zshrc template.
  * Windows: Install linux or get a mac. Even with WSL you will install linux anyways so why not get the real thing(get Kubuntu / KDE Neon)
  * Linux: https://ohmyz.sh/#install
  * Mac: https://ohmyz.sh/#install
  
* Start configuring your zsh by editing the .zshrc. My file is included in the repo. For plugins that are not found, go through their oh-my-zsh installations from their respective git repos
* Copy the themes to ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes

And this will give you this awesome terminal.

You might also need to set some margins, padding and other visual settings in the terminal application to make it look closer.

Snazzy color theme is available for most terminals and looks awesome.
